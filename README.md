# Vetuspace
A 90's desktop environment inside your browser, along with a neat little Netscape-inspired fake browser for 90s-like "websites".

Websites are loaded from the [websites repo](https://github.com/MarNicGit/Vetuspace-Websites).

## Build
Just clone the repository, navigate to the `src` directory and run `dotnet watch run`.
